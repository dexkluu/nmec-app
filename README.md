## Overview and Data
Measuring and verifying energy savings after implementing an energy conservation measure (ECM) is an essential part in understanding the return on investment of the ECM. I created an app that allows users to quantify savings following a data modeling approach. This requires metered energy data at the hourly or daily level. 

View the app at the following link: [https://dexterluu-ucsf.shinyapps.io/nmec-app/](https://dexterluu-ucsf.shinyapps.io/nmec-app/)

## Tools Used

I created the app in R using R Shiny and deployed it via Shiny Apps. The models utilize kW Engineering's nmecr R package.
